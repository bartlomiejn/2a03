# 2a03

NES emulator written in C++. 

#### Build

`make binary CXX={Your C++ compiler}`

I've put my compiler temporarily as the default value which most definitely won't work with your setup, so make sure to fill it in. 

#### Feature list:
- Memory access
- Instruction cycle
- Addressing modes
- Official instruction list
- Interrupts
- iNESv1 Cartridge model with loading

#### In progress:
- Cartridge mapper
- Binary execution
- Automated tests
