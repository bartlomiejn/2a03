# 2a03

NES emulator written in C++. 

I implement it based mostly on 6502.org documentation and nestest.log file.

Since there are several other fully-featured emulators with publicly available source code, I avoid using any of these unless I'm heavily stuck at something.

Current feature list:
- Memory access
- Instruction cycle
- Addressing modes

In progress:
- Official opcodes - about 1/3 implemented.
